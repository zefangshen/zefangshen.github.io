I develop AI-based solutions and conduct novel Machine Learning research. See my talk at the <a href="https://www.science.org.au/news-and-events/events/public-speaker-series/the-journey-of-australian-science/prescott-and-soil-science">Australian Academy of Science</a> (below) for a glimpse into my work.

I possess expertise in building data science pipelines using Python and R. I applied various machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, XGBoost, Gaussian Processes) and deep learning architectures (convolutional neural networks, LSTMs, attention-based models) to deliver high-impact solutions. My work has resulted in high-quality publications and real-world applications.

My research tackles challenging problems in machine learning for spectroscopy and robotics, resulting in publications in top tier journals such as ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (IF12.7, 2022), Earth-Science Reviews (IF12.1), Global Change Biology (IF11.6), Communications earth & environment (IF7.9), SOIL(IF6.8), etc. Of particular distinction is my receipt of the <a href="https://asmejmd.org/2019/10/01/announcing-the-journal-of-mechanical-design-2018-editors-choice-paper-award/">Journal of Mechanical Design 2018 Editors' Choice Paper Award</a> given to one article among all in 2018 for fundamental contribution in robotic design.

I am passionate about transforming research outputs into real-world solutions. With my full-stack data science skills (backend: Python Django; frontend: Bootstrap/React; Deployment: AWS), I implemented machine learning pipelines for the modeling of spectral data into a web application, which resulted in the worldâ€™s first global service for estimating of soil organic carbon with spectra.

    <h4>Artificial Intelligence for Soil Science</h4>
    <p>Australian Academy of Science, Canberra, 09/04/2024</p>
    <p>I was honored to be invited by the Australian Academy of Science to share my expertise in developing AI for Soil Science at the public speaker series: The Journey of Australian Science. The talk focused on challenges in soil spectroscopic modelling and our solutions. I also shared my thoughts on future directions of AI research and applications in Soil Science.</p>
