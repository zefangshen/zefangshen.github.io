<p class="text-justify">I develop AI-based solutions and conduct novel Machine Learning research. See my talk at the <a href="https://www.science.org.au/news-and-events/events/public-speaker-series/the-journey-of-australian-science/prescott-and-soil-science">Australian Academy of Science</a> (below) for a glimpse into my work.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I am experienced in building data science pipelines using Python and R. I applied various machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, XGBoost, Gaussian Processes) and deep learning architectures (convolutional neural networks, LSTMs, attention-based models) to deliver high-impact solutions. My work has resulted in high-quality publications and real-world applications.</p>

<p class="text-justify">My research tackles challenging problems in machine learning for spectroscopy and robotics, resulting in publications in top tier journals such as ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (IF12.7, 2022), Earth-Science Reviews (IF12.1), Global Change Biology (IF11.6), Communications earth & environment (IF7.9), SOIL(IF6.8), etc. Of particular distinction is my receipt of the <a href="https://asmejmd.org/2019/10/01/announcing-the-journal-of-mechanical-design-2018-editors-choice-paper-award/">Journal of Mechanical Design 2018 Editors' Choice Paper Award</a> given to one article among all in 2018 for fundamental contribution in robotic design.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I am passionate about transforming research outputs into real-world solutions. With my full-stack data science skills (backend: Python Django; frontend: Bootstrap/React; Deployment: AWS), I implemented machine learning pipelines for the modeling of spectral data into a web application, which resulted in the worldâ€™s first global service for estimating of soil organic carbon with spectra.</p>

    <h4>Artificial Intelligence for Soil Science</h4>
    <p>Australian Academy of Science, Canberra, 09/04/2024</p>
    <p class="text-justify">I was honored to be invited by the Australian Academy of Science to share my expertise in developing AI for Soil Science at the public speaker series: The Journey of Australian Science. The talk focused on challenges in soil spectroscopic modelling and our solutions. I also shared my thoughts on future directions of AI research and applications in Soil Science.</p>
