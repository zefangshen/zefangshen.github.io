[Spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy) has a wide range of applications across various fields of science and industry.

Spectroscopy is used to determine the atomic structure and composition of chemical compounds. This is particularly useful in structure analysis, where techniques like NMR, IR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry are often combined to provide comprehensive information about a substance's structure. Spectroscopic methods are employed for incoming goods inspection, process control, and quality assurance. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is frequently used due to its non-destructive nature, speed, and ability to provide real-time results. Spectroscopy is used for quality control and detection of contaminants in food products.
Forensics and toxicology: Various spectroscopic techniques are used to identify substances in criminal investigations, analyze trace evidence (like fibers or paint chips), and detect toxins or doping substances. Spectroscopy is used to analyze soil samples for toxicological contamination and in other environmental applications. In Astronomy, spectroscopy is crucial for studying the composition of stars, galaxies, and exoplanets. It's used to determine the speed and velocity of distant objects through redshift measurements.

Spectroscopy provides valuable insights across a broad spectrum of scientific and industrial fields. The non-destructive nature, speed, and accuracy of many spectroscopic techniques make them indispensable tools in modern research and industry.

Machine learning methods {% cite shen2021automated %} can more efficiently extract valuable information from spectral data, creating unprecedented opportunities for analytical science. This allows researchers to gain deeper insights from spectroscopic measurements. The combination of spectroscopy and machine learning offers opportunities to achieve high throughput and impressive levels of analytical accuracy. This is particularly important in fields such as material science, biomedical applications, and food science.

This project aims develop common machine learning solutions for spectroscopy in various fields.
