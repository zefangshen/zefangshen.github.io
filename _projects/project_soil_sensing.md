Soil monitoring helps maintain ideal moisture, nutrient levels, and pH for specific crops. This promotes healthy plant growth and maximizes yield potential. Sensing based soil monitoring can provide rapid, cost-efficient assessment of soil conditions that support the management of soil.

This automated soil sensing system integrates multiple sensors, such as cameras, spectrometers, and machine learning to analyse various soil properties.

I worked on the control software for a spectrometer, prototype of a soil core feeding mechanism, and developed machine learning approaches {% cite shen2022miniaturised %} to model the spectra data to estimate soil properties.

This project was selected by the [Curtin Accelerate](https://www.curtin.edu.au/engage/entrepreneurs/accelerate/) program for its commercialisation potential. For a quick view of the project please see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejObWZA1Wbo).
